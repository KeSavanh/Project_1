# Project_1
## Does income level determine exposure to extreme weather in California?
  ![California map](data_output/Figures/printable-california-county-map-labeled.png)

# Background
* Motivation: Income level can determine exposure to extreme weather across the globe.
Lim et al. 2020 found that in the United States from 1996-2001, higher income reduced extreme heat vulnerability, while poverty intensified extreme heat vulnerability
* Hypothesis: In the state of California, counties with lower income and higher poverty rates have more exposure to extreme weather (high temperatures, extreme drought, wildfires).

## Motivation and Questions
The objective of this analysis is to answer the questions below:
    * Do populations with lower income & higher poverty rates experience higher temperatures?
    * Are populations with lower income & higher poverty rates more likely to experience extreme and exceptional drought conditions? 
    * Do counties with higher poverty rates experience more wildfires than counties with lower poverty rates?
## Data source
Household income and poverty rate data from 2010 to 2019 was retrieved by performing API calls from [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/guidance/api-user-guide.Available_Data.html). Data set of Daily Maximum Temperature (F) was obtained from [NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information ](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/global-hourly?dataTypes=TMP&bbox=42.002,-124.393,32.536,-114.125&place=State%20or%20Province:25&startDate=2010-01-01T00:00:00&endDate=2019-12-31T23:59:590) in `csv` format and the same with drought severity which contains the percentage of the population experiencing exceptional drought and was derived from  [U.S. Drought Monitor ](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/DataDownload/ComprehensiveStatistics.aspx). Lastly, wildfire data from 2013 to 2019, was acquired from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/ananthu017/california-wildfire-incidents-20132020/metadata) which includes includes acres burned. The datasets were gathered in the following subfolder [Resources](https://github.com/KeSavanh/Project_1/tree/main/Main/Resources)


## Data Cleanup and Exploration
The data cleaning process was carried out using `jupyter notebook`, `pandas library`, and some relevant modules. 
The performance includes:
Creating and merging data frames.
Renaming columns.
Identifying and removing nulls.
Dropping and filtering unrelated columns.
The cleaned data was saved to a separate folder [data_output](https://github.com/KeSavanh/Project_1/tree/main/Main/data_output) and be ready for analysis.

## Data Analysis
Analysis and visualization was conducted in a seperate notebook [Analysis](https://github.com/KeSavanh/Project_1/blob/main/Main/Analysis.ipynb). Plots from the analysis were saved in [Figures](https://github.com/KeSavanh/Project_1/tree/main/Main/data_output/Figures)

## Summary and Discusion
* Results Summary: Counties with lower median household incomes and higher poverty rates experienced higher daily maximum temperatures but similar exposure to extreme and exceptional drought categories. 

* Temperature: 
    * High poverty rate and low income were only correlated with higher maximum daily temperatures

* Drought: 
    * Most income groups experience some extreme and exceptional drought conditions 

* Wildfire: 
    * There does not appear to be a strong correlation between income level and wildfires within California counties.

* Next steps
    * Compare household income and poverty in counties that experience extreme temperatures (>103.9 F, exceptional drought, and high wildfire frequency)  
    * Extend analysis to other western states experiencing extreme heat, drought, and wildfires
